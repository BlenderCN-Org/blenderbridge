I got bpy into pycharm by doing this:
1. download http://airplanes3d.net/downloads/pyd...ev-blender.zip - autocompletion files for the most Blender API classes, and the script, which generates them
2. unzip into Blender folder(where blender.exe is).
3. go into doc folder and run refresh_python_api.bat.
4. go into doc\python_api\pypredef folder and change all extensions to .py instead of pypredef.
5. cut or copy contents of pypredef folder to you Python's Lib folder.
